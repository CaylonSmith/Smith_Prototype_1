                <p>
                  My goal for this project was to design and code a personal
                  website, which i would use to host; my portfolio for potetntial
                  employers,a blog and any other information i might need.
                </p>

              <main>
                <p>
                  The following are a couple wireframes i played around with in
                  order to get a feel about how my website would flow.
                </p>
  
                <figure>
                  <img src="/images/wireframe_1_homepage_1.jpg" alt="booga pic" />
  
                  <figcaption>first version of my homepage wireframe</figcaption>
                </figure>
  
                <figure>
                  <img src="/images/wireframe_1_homepage_2.jpg" alt="booga pic" />
  
                  <figcaption>second version of my homepage wireframe</figcaption>
                </figure>
  
                <p>
                  I made a second version because i felt like i wanted to
                  understand why certain people have thier personal picture on
                  thier websites.
                  <br />
                  doing my research i found that mostly personal pictures made the
                  viewer more comfortable and connected them to the person,
                  therefore they were more trusting.
                </p>

                <figure>
                  <img
                    src="/images/Wireframe_1_Blog_Selection_1.jpg"
                    alt="booga pic"
                  />
  
                  <figcaption>

                  </figcaption>
                </figure>
  
                <p>
                  with this design i wanted to make a blog selection screen where
                  the user could see all the blogs and select the one the want to
                  read.
                </p>

              <main>
                <p>
                  Most of my wireframes felt abit lacking ,so instead i decided to
                  do some rough user research.This would help or guide me while
                  making my next wireframes.Again these are not a concrete way to
                  go about research and i will spend more time on actual visible
                  user research and testing.
                </p>
                <h3>Personas</h3>
                <figure>
                  <img src="/images/Persona_1.jpg" alt="booga pic" />
  
                  <figcaption>Marker Persona</figcaption>
                </figure>
  
                <figure>
                  <img src="/images/Persona_2.jpg" alt="booga pic" />
  
                  <figcaption>Student Persona</figcaption>
                </figure>
  
                <figure>
                  <img src="/images/Persona_3.jpg" alt="booga pic" />
  
                  <figcaption>Employer Persona</figcaption>
                </figure>
  
                <p>
                  With these persona's i wanted to dive a bit in to my users mind
                  and get a more narrow passage on how i can design my website.
                </p>
  
                <h3>Key pattern derived from Personas</h3>
  
                <p>
                  All three chunked personas have limited time so they need to be
                  able to get where they want to quickly and efficiently
                </p>
  
                <figure>
                  <img src="/images/SiteMap.jpg" alt="booga pic" />

                </figure>
  
                <p>
                  To make my wireframe design much more narrowed , i also made a
                  site map in addition to personas
                </p>

                  The following are my second round of website wireframes based on
                  my rough research

                <p>
                  When it came to this redesign i wanted to phase out an about me
                  and contact section.My social media is the best way to get in
                  contact so they will be available on every page at the top
                  right.I included a small paragraph that kind off describes me.
                  The Quick links below my Introduction was including incase the
                  user wanted to quickly jump to lastest uploaded things instead
                  of going through selection screens to get to the lastest
                  uploaded content. this lessens risk of user painpoints.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />

                <p>
                  here users would select from an array of blogs.i wanted to
                  include a tiny abstract so that users know what they are about
                  to read and if they were to lazy i added the image on the side
                  to signal what the blog might be about.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />

                </figure>
  
                <p>
                  here i just wanted to keep it simple with out complicating
                  things since the main thing they will be doing is reading and i
                  dont want anything to distract them pr drag thier attention.i
                  included the estimated time not for show but so that the user is
                  not intimidated by the mass about of text.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />

                </figure>
  
                <p>
                  This was the hardest to design for i feel as the content would
                  be quite abit and most likely the user will be scrolling from
                  one point in the whole page to another to perhaps compare or
                  etc. so i included a index on the left that would remain static
                  as the user goes up and down the page so that they can jump to a
                  section fast and efficiently with out have to scroll eliminating
                  another pain point.

                  The following is my style guide.i started by creating a mood
                  board, i used the mood board to dictate my typography and
                  pallette.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <h3>Mood board</h3>
                <p>
                  In order to create my mood board and set my aesthetic, i went to
                  pinterest and sat there for abit looking up designs and
                  illustrations that inspired me.Most of my favourite ones came
                  from asian themed designs.I then grouped the ones i most liked
                  together.They gave me a retro old timey feel hence most of my
                  website i tried to keep that in mind.
                </p>

                <p>
                  My main inspiration for this font was its old aestheticand feel,
                  also it was one of the fonts <cite>W3 schools</cite> recommended
                  as the best web safe fonts.

                <p>
                  This pallete was mainly inspired by one of the artworks in my
                  mood board.These colours were simple and not used as much
                  compared to colours like red ,blue etc.In order to make sure my
                  website is not all over the place i used the 60-30-10 Colour
                  rule so the beige colour would take most of the website as its
                  least distracting and the orange would be the 10 percent as it
                  is very bright , it would only be used to draw the users eyes to
                  important things.

                <p>
                  i would say i am very disappointed with the final product there
                  are many user painpoints and just things that dont look nor feel
                  right ,for example my blog selection page looks very ugly and i
                  found that users did not know if they should click it, mostly
                  they thought that , that page was the blog.Looking at my code i
                  found myself creating ids when i could have used classes
                  instead, also i crated multiple ids of basically the same thing
                  i would be formating on another page making my code somewhat
                  hard and long to read.Overall i will have to redesign alot in
                  future and maybe deep dive in my user testing in a more
                  realistic sense.
