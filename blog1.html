      <p class="blogSubHeadings">What is that</p>
      <p>
        The quantitative data and information are abstract as they describe
        things that are not physical. As a result of quantitative data and
        information being abstract, they become confusing and unusable therefore
        we must devise ways to present the quantitative data and information
        more physically and qualitatively. (Fullstory, 2022)
      </p>

      <p>
        We can represent quantitative data and information more physically and
        qualitatively by using Data visualization (Fullstory, 2022). Data
        visualization is the representation of quantitative data and information
        in a graphical context using pictorial elements such as Tables, charts,
        graphs, trees, scatter plots, diagrams, and maps (brush & Burns, 2020)
        (Li, 2020). Data visualization aids human cognition and provides new
        insights while also teaching the reader about said information.
        (Hazzard, 2015) (Li, 2020)
      </p>
      <p class="blogSubHeadings">
        What exactly though are we trying to reinterpret in a visual context?
        what exactly is quantitative data and information?
      </p>
      <p>
        Data is raw unprocessed information and usually has less to no meaning.
        Data is represented as individual quantitative figures and numbers (Li,
        2020). Information on the other hand is data that has been processed
        it’s the perception of the data that has been collected. Information is
        most often used and has meaning attached. (Hill, 2021)
      </p>

      <p>
        Example scenario: the English premiere league is a football association
        and league (premier league, 2022) in which teams compete against each
        other to get more points than any other team and therefore win the
        league. As a result, they must collect data such as top goal scorers in
        the league the collection of the people who scored the goals in the
        league alone is classified as data as those statistics on their own mean
        nothing but through the processing of that information I could determine
        patterns like which clubs have more goal scorers than the others, for
        example, the top goal scorers for the league last year had jota, mane,
        and salah, they all play for Liverpool and Liverpool finished close
        second it would not be a stretch to say that Liverpool having those
        players score those many goals were a factor in Liverpool finishing so
        high. The process is simple: collect and interpret data, gain
        information, present information, and gain insight. (premier league,
        2022)
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, what is quantitative data? Well, this is collected data that have a
        numerical value, this data is measured in numbers and counted in them
        too. Quantitative data answers questions such as how many and how much.
        (Fullstory, 2022)
      </p>

      <p>
        We can collect two types of data being, secondary data, and primary
        data. Secondary data is data that has already been collected you can use
        this data to help guide your research or make your data feel a more
        concrete example of secondary data might be a company database that
        contains information collected previously by the company in the past.
        Primary Data is data that you collect and can manipulate variables
        around the collection of the data. ( Formplus Blog, 2022)
      </p>

      <p>
        Cognition is primarily managed by the cerebral cortex, to process data
        and or information on its own takes a lot of effort and thinking, the
        process of this data is also quite slow and thus hard (Few, 2022)
        (Mnguni, 2014). Data visualization presents information in a way that
        our eyes can judge and understand, it lessens the processing load of our
        brain as it uses its abilities more efficiently (Few, 2022). Data
        visualization uses human visual perception to process information
        extremely fast and efficiently, we immediately require less cognition
        (i.e thinking) and therefore understand and interpret the information
        intuitively. Visual perception is controlled by the visual cortex. (Few,
        2022) (Li, 2020) (Mnguni, 2014)
      </p>

      <p>
        To achieve this intuitive characteristic, our graphical representation
        has to be efficient accurate, and meaningful. Some guiding questions to
        ask may be as follows (Few, 2022):
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Does my representation clearly indicate the nature of the relationship
          between the values?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Does my representation represent the quantities accurately?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Does my representation make it easy to compare the quantities?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Does my representation make it easy to see the ranked order of values?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Does my representation make it obvious how people should use the
          information?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="blogSubHeadings">Data visualization in games</p>
      <p>
        Now to understand Data visualization even further let’s look at how they
        function in games. Most if not all games at their core are about
        learning whether it be learning the game’s main mechanics or rules, most
        of the time we will be learning and using what we learned to beat or
        play the game. Data visualization provides a way to help a player learn
        and understand the game space in which they are participating. (Hazzard,
        2015) (Meeks, 2018)
      </p>
      <p class="blogSubHeadings">Game data visualization types:</p>
      <p class="blogSubHeadings">Non-diegetic data visualizations</p>
      <p>
        Many games utilize data visualizations that are non-diegetic. These
        visualizations are generally made to not look like they belong or exist
        in the video games world. These visualizations exist to only communicate
        information to the player (Hazzard, 2015) (Meeks, 2018)
      </p>
      <p class="blogSubHeadings">diegetic data visualizations</p>
      <p>
        Some games use utilize data visualizations that are diegetic. These
        visualizations are generally made to fit inside the video games world.
        These visualizations exist to assist the players moment to moment
        gameplay decisions, for example, some games color code enemies by the
        difficulty which therefore could help the player decide if they are
        equipped to engage with that enemy or not. data visualizations put into
        a diegetic form help make a game feel more immersive and make the
        visualizations less just pasted on. (Hazzard, 2015) (Meeks, 2018)
      </p>
      <p class="blogSubHeadings">
        Why have data visualization In games though?
      </p>
      <p>
        Data visualization helps the brain think less as a result because the
        player is thinking less they are not only able to learn the rules of the
        game easier and faster they can have fun and not quit the game. As a
        result of needing to think, fewer players can immerse themselves more
        into the game and enter a flow state. Overall Data visualization helps
        communicate vital information to players and helps in crafting an
        amazing user experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion, Data visualization is a key element in modern human
        information processing, it can be used in different facets of life,
        business, and sectors not covered here. The look at data visualization
        in games is just but a small piece of evidence as to how powerful of a
        tool it is and how advantageous it could be to learn it.
